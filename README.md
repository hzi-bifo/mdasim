## bioconda

The easiest way to install MDAsim is via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/). For the required one time setup of conda and bioconda, please refer to [bioconda's installation instructions](https://bioconda.github.io/#using-bioconda). Once this is done, all you need to do is issue the following command:

```
conda install mdasim
```

## build from source

To build MDAsim from source, download the latest [tagged release](https://github.com/hzi-bifo/mdasim/releases) and unpack it. Alternatively, you can install the latest version of the repository by cloning it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/hzi-bifo/mdasim.git
```

Enter the created directory:

```
cd mdasim
```

To install in a `bin` folder in this source directory, just run:
```
make
```

To install to a `bin` folder at a custom location, run:
```
