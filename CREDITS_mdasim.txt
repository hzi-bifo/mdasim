Most part of the code in MDAsim 1.2 is written by Zeinab Taghavi (ztaghavi@wayne.edu).
Some part of the code is borrowed from package HyDA (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hyda/).

Many thanks to Hamidreza Chitsaz and Sorin Draghici for helpful discussions.

Code additions and cleanups from MDAsim 2.0 onwards have been authored and reviewed by Victoria Sack (victoria.sack@helmholtz-hzi.de) and David LÃ¤hnemann (david.laehnemann@helmholtz-hzi.de).
