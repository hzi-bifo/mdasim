E/ Examples

The following command is an example of usage of mdasim 
$ ./bin/mdasim -I=Staphylococcus_aureus_USA300_FPR3757.fa -C=50 > mdasim_S_aureus.log

The accompanying example files with the package are 
- primerList.fasta: list of input primers.
- Staphylococcus_aureus_USA300_FPR3757.fa: reference input dna sequence.
- mdasim_S_aureus.log: log file of the output of the command.

F/ Q&A

Q1 - What is the format of outAmplicons.fasta?
A1 - The format is fasta. The ID line of each amplicon is in the following format:
>XX | name = RXX | fragment = XX | position = XX
The first two values of the ID line for each amplicon is the length of the amplicon and the name of the amplicon. The name of the amplicon is in the format of R(Index of the amplicon). Indexes of amplicons start from 1 and increase for each amplicon by one. The last one shows the total number of amplicons in the file. 
The last two values in each line are mostly used for debugging the program. The number that comes after the term "fragment = " is the ID of the fragment that the respective amplicon comes from. In fact, as it is described in [1], the amplicons are generated by cleaving fragments from the positions the double- and single-starnded regions meet (look at 3rd step of the algorithm in [1]). The number that comes after the term "position = " is the position of the last nucleotide of the amplicon in the respective fragment.

Q2 - How can we find the position of the amplicons in the genome?
A2 - The program does not store the position of the amplicons in the genome. However, to find these values aligner softwares, for example bwa (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), can be used to align the amplicons to the genome. 

Q3 - How much RAM is needed to run the simulator?
A3 - The required memory is linearly proportinal to the size of input genome and the final coverage. For example for the S. aureus sample for which the size of the genome is in the order of 3M, to get 50x average coverage 6G RAM is needed. Also, for a genome of size 3G to get average coverage of 50x, approximately 6T of RAM is needed. 
One suggestion to reduce the required memory size for large genomes is to break the genome to smaller pieces (may be with some overlaps), then apply MDAsim on each piece, separately.
